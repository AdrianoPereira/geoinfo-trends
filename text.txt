The increasing urban population sets new demands for mobility solutions. The impacts of traffic congestions or inefficient transit connectivity directly affect public health (e.g. emissions and stress) and the city economy (e.g. deaths in road accidents, productivity, and commuting). In parallel, the advance of technology has made it easier to obtain data about the systems which make up the city information systems. This paper takes advantage of GIS and real-time data to present: 1) a web application integrating multiple services; 2) an android application for bus visualization and prediction and 3) a dashboard focused on applying exploratory data analysis techniques on ticketing data.
